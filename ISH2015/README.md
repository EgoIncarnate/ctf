Insomni'Hack 2015 Finals
========================

`firmare/` is the Firm(ware) task. Exploit a MIPS router! Didn't manage to finish it by the end of the compteition, as I tried too hard to do a sleep()/cache-flushing ROP before jumping to a shellcode, or ROPing to `system('/bin/sh')`. Apparently the emulator the orgs were running doesn't really simulate MIPS cache correctly, so all that time wasted.

Oh well!
