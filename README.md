q3k's CTF notes & solutions
===========================

This is a git repo based on my ~/CTF directory. A while ago I started commiting any intersting tasks, tidbits or solutions that I come up with.

Please keep in mind this is pretty much raw and braindump-like in nature. Code that is provided is probably super ugly, as it is with one-off hacks. If you want some nice Python code, look at different repos :).
